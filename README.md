Project "Fun Food Friends" is on explaning firebase using react

#What is Firebase?

Google's Firebase is a cloud-based database hosting service that will set up a database for you and host it, as well as offer you the tools to interact with it. You can use it to store and retrieve data in real time. That's not all Firebase does, it can do more things like handle user authentication and store files, but we'll be mainly focusing on data storage.

The data storage ability of Firebase make it a perfect fit for React. A persistent, real-time backend for your application to plug in to!
